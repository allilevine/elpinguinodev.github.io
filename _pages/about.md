Have you ever wondered, "Who made that mural?", "Where'd that mural go that I really like?", or "How can I get something like that done for me?" The goal of this website is to provide the people of Christchurch and its visitors information about all of the murals in town. We try to include all big wall murals regardless of crew affiliation, commissioned backing, etc. If you've noticed our map is out of date, please help us by sending in new images, locations, or details. Check out our Get Involved section.
